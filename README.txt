CREATIVE COMPONENT

(1) GENERAL COMMENTS
I plan to create a simple solar system model, 
I still can showcase how planets are arranged in a grander view. 
I can use WASD to simulate planets to orbit the sun.
The initial view of the solar system is actual image of where the 
planets are right now, but I try very hard to approximate their locations 
in the future by calculating angular velocity in radians, 
and now we can approximate their locations in the future and past.
(2) A FEW THINGS I LEARNED WHILE WORKING ON THE CREATIVE COMPONENT
working with circular motion using sin and cos.
(3) ATTRIBUTIONS -- CODE or DATA borrowed from elsewhere
space image from the web.
